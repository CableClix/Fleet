## UISwitch

Given you have some UIViewController that looks like this:
```swift
class ControllerUnderTest: UIViewController {
	@IBOutlet weak var someSwitch: UISwitch?

// rest of code here
// ...
}
```

When you want to test the behavior that backs the view controller's `switch`, rather than doing something like:

```swift
let controller = getControllerUnderTest() as? ControllerUnderTest
controller?.someSwitch?.setOn(false, animated: false)
```

you can use Fleet's extension `flip` like so:

```swift
let controller = getControllerUnderTest() as? ControllerUnderTest
let _ = controller?.someSwitch?.flip()
```

`flip` on `UISwitch` toggles the switch without animating it. Additionally, it returns a `FleetError` optional 
that will contain an error in the following situations:
1) The `UISwitch` is not visible
2) The `UISwitch` is not enabled

By contrast, calling the `setOn(_, animated:)` method yourself will give you no indication of whether a user
could even have interacted with that object in the first place.
