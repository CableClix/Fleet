# Fleet
Fleet is a UIKit-focused testing framework intended for use on iOS projects written in Swift.

## Features
Fleet extends UIKit classes in order to make it easier to test your code's interactions with UIKit. Following are summaries of the major features for each extended class. The [Documentation folder](./Documentation) contains more information about these features, as well as sample code showing you how they are intended to be used. 

- [UIStoryboard](./Documentation/UIStoryboard.md) - Supports injection of view controller fakes into a storyboard. It even supports injection into storyboard references. 
- [UIViewController](./Documentation/UIViewController.md) - Allows specs to test view controller presentation and dismissal without waiting for the UI run-loop.
- [UIButton](./Documentation/UIButton.md) - Provides convenience methods for interacting with buttons in test.
